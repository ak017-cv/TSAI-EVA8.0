<h1 align="center">EVA 8.0 (Extensive Vision AI)</h1>

This contains the solutions to the assignments given in The School of AI - Extensive Vision AI 8.0

1. [Python Basics](Coming soon)
   
2. [Neural Architecture](Coming soon)

3. [First Neural Network](Coming soon)

4. [PyTorch 101](Coming soon)

5. [Architecture Basics](https://github.com/ak112/TSAI-EVA8.0/blob/master/03_Architecture_Basics/README.md)
   
   Here we were required to train MNIST to achieve 99.4% accuracy with given constraints.
   
6. [Coding Drill](https://github.com/ak112/TSAI-EVA8.0/blob/master/04_CodingDrillDown/README.md)

   This was very important to realise the basic steps required to make a neural network and then go on to optimize it, to get the perfect model size and accuracy, very      important, please see its documentation, and all the notebooks
   
7. [Normalization Regularization](https://github.com/ak112/TSAI-EVA8.0/blob/master/05_NormalizationRegularization/README.md)
    
    This assigment focuses on the importance of normalization and regularization in neural networks.
